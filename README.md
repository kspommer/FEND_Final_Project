# Madison MicroBreweries #
Developer:  Susan Pommer
October 2018
Udacity Front End NanoDegree Program, Project 7

## To use the program
The map displays 10 breweries in Madison, WI -- establishments identified as "breweries" by the FourSquare's Search for Venues API.  On click of a marker or brewery name on the side panel, an infowindow is displayed with additional information on the brewery, as obtained from FourSquare's Get Details of a Venue API.  A filter is provided to help the user efficiently locate a brewery of interest.  The application can be viewed on all screen sizes and is accessible.

## To run the program
1.  Navigate to the correct directory
2.  Enter 'npm start'

## Resources
Many thanks to @Forrest, Coach Doug and @Rodrick, who Udacity should all hire and without whom many of us would not still be same.   And of course, my study buddies Amy and Tom, and our fearless community leaders Kelsey and Brenda.  Wish I could buy them all a beer at The Capital Brewery!
